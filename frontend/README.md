# PropPilot Front-End Engineering Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the engineering plan for the PropPilot front-end application, focusing on a conversational, command-free user experience driven by AI. The goal is to create an intuitive and efficient interface that guides users through the RFP response process with ease.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js (React framework with server-side rendering, routing, and API capabilities)
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (for predictable state management and efficient data handling)
*   **UI Component Library:** Material UI (for a consistent and professional look and feel with customizable components)
*   **Styling:** Styled Components (for CSS-in-JS, enabling component-level styling and maintainability)
*   **Form Management:** React Hook Form (for efficient and flexible form handling)
*   **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library (for unit and integration testing)
*   **Build Tool:** Webpack (integrated with Next.js for bundling and optimization)


## 3. Architecture

The front-end architecture will be based on a component-based approach, with a clear separation of concerns. Key modules and components include:

*   **Chat Interface:**
    *   **Chat Component:** The core component that displays the chat conversation and handles user input.
    *   **Message Component:** Displays individual chat messages, including text, buttons, forms, and other dynamic elements.
    *   **Input Component:** Handles user input, including text and file uploads.
*   **LLM Integration:**
    *   **LLM Service:** Handles communication with the LLM backend API.
    *   **Intent Handler:** Processes the intents recognized by the LLM and triggers the appropriate actions.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **Redux Store:** Stores the application state, including the conversation history, proposal data, and user context.
    *   **Reducers:** Update the state based on actions dispatched from the components.
    *   **Selectors:** Extract data from the state for use in the components.
*   **Dynamic Component Rendering:**
    *   **Component Mapper:** Maps intents to specific React components for dynamic rendering in the chat interface.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   **API Service:** Handles communication with the back-end API.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Reusable UI components from Material UI, such as buttons, forms, tables, and dialogs.

## 4. User Journey Implementation

The front-end will implement the conversational, command-free user journey described earlier, with the following key features:

*   **Welcome and Onboarding:**
    *   Display a friendly welcome message and guide the user through the initial setup.
    *   Use Dialogflow to understand the user's intent and provide appropriate options.
*   **RFP Upload and Requirement Extraction:**
    *   Allow the user to upload an RFP document.
    *   Display the extracted requirements in a structured format.
    *   Use Dialogflow to confirm or edit the extracted requirements.
*   **Proposal Creation and Content Generation:**
    *   Generate a proposal outline based on the RFP requirements.
    *   Allow the user to create and edit proposal content using the rich text editor.
    *   Use Dialogflow to provide AI-powered content suggestions and compliance feedback.
*   **Collaboration and Review:**
    *   Allow the user to invite team members to collaborate on the proposal.
    *   Implement role-based access control.
    *   Facilitate real-time collaboration and review.
*   **Compliance Validation and Submission:**
    *   Run a compliance check to ensure the proposal meets all RFP requirements.
    *   Provide guidance on how to resolve any compliance issues.
    *   Allow the user to submit the proposal.

## 5. Engineering Tasks

*   **Set up Next.js project:** Create a new Next.js project with the chosen technology stack.
*   **Implement Chat Interface:** Develop the core chat component and message component.
*   **Integrate Dialogflow:** Set up a Dialogflow agent and integrate it with the front-end.
*   **Implement State Management:** Set up the Redux store and reducers.
*   **Implement Dynamic Component Rendering:** Create the component mapper and implement the dynamic rendering logic.
*   **Implement API Integration:** Create the API service and integrate it with the back-end API.
*   **Develop UI Components:** Create reusable UI components using Material UI.
*   **Implement User Journey:** Implement the conversational, command-free user journey.
*   **Implement Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for all components and modules.
*   **Deploy Front-End:** Deploy the front-end to a hosting platform such as Vercel or Netlify.

## 6. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and functions in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components and modules.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Test the entire user journey from start to finish.
*   **Accessibility Tests:** Ensure the front-end is accessible to users with disabilities.

## 7. Deployment

The front-end will be deployed to a hosting platform such as Vercel or Netlify.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Personalization:** Implement personalized recommendations and content suggestions based on user data.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Track user behavior and provide insights into proposal performance.
*   **Integration with Other Tools:** Integrate with other tools, such as CRM systems and project management software.

## 9. Conclusion

This engineering plan provides a detailed roadmap for developing the PropPilot front-end application. By following this plan, we can create a user-friendly, efficient, and effective interface that helps businesses win more RFPs.
